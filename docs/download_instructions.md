### Linux
To downlod on Linux first make sure you have python 3 or 3.4 installed. To check run `python --version` if you get
`Python 2.7.9` or `Python 2.x.x` try `python3 --version` if you get `Python 3.4.2` or `Python 3.4.x` you should be good.

After that run `git clone https://github.com/BenIanGifford/car_adventure.git` to download the repository and put it in your home
directory as `car_adventure` then run `python3 car_adventure/engine.py` this will open an interpreter to play the game. 
Have Fun! :smiley:
